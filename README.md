# Mean-Stress
Field data set to model flow to wells due to Earth and atmospheric tides.

# Notes
In this study, a novel analytical solution was derived to model flow to wells caused by atmospheric tides. The analytical solution can be inverted to estimate subsurface properties. A dataset from the northern region of Australia was utilized to demonstrate the process of inverting the analytical solution for passive subsurface characterization.

The data set contained in B1 and B2 correspons to two borholes.
